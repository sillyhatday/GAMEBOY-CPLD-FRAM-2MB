## Software

This is a copy of the free programming software from Altera/Intel. It is not hosted on Intels website any more. There is a new version of this software that is hosted still, but I did not try it as it is likely that MAX3000 support is dropped.

You can source your own copy if you like or try out the newest version from Intel.
